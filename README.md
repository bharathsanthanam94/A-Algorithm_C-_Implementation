# A-Algorithm_C++_Implementation

A* algorithm is implemented in C++. 

Input file is a grid of 1's and 0's. Zeros indicate free path and 1's indicate obstacles in the grid.

Origin grid: [0,0]
Output grid: [4,5]

The output file gives an optimal path through the grid, "P"  in the output file indicates optimal path to reach from goal to destination node.
